Help for FGROUP:

FGROUP registers the given nickname to a specified
account.  This means that &nick& protects this nickname
the same way as it protects the account name.  Most
services commands will accept the new nickname as
an alias for your account name.

Please note that grouped nicks expire separately
from accounts.  To prevent this, you must use them.
Otherwise, all properties of the account are shared
among all nicks registered to it.

If an account name is not specified, the nick will be
grouped to your account.

Syntax: FGROUP <nickname> [accountname]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FGROUP SomeNick
    /msg &nick& FGROUP SomeName SomeNick
