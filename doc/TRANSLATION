Xtheme uses GNU Gettext for translation of strings that are
user-visible. This allows for networks to change the language that
Xtheme uses for its interface.

We would like your help with translating Xtheme into your native
language. In order to do this, I suggest installing a po-file
editor such as poEdit. poEdit is a lot nicer for translation work
than a traditional text editor, although that will do as well, as
long as the file is in UTF-8.

To start the translation, you should open xtheme.pot in a text
editor or poEdit. In poEdit, you can start a new project using the
pot, which is more useful than just editing it, but that is not
covered here.

Once you have completed the translation, you should file a bug on
the xtheme bugtracker, and attach the file.

Users can set their language using /msg NickServ SET LANGUAGE.
The default language is set in xtheme.conf. The localization
environment variables (LANG in particular) affect the charset
used for the translated messages, but not help files, and also,
gettext may refuse to translate anything at all if LANG is not
set or set to "C" or "POSIX".
